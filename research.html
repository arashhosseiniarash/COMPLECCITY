          <h6>Non-deterministic Workspace Management in Construction (Hady)</h6>
          <p>
            Spatial Temporal (Operational) Clashes happen when workspaces
            overlap to share the same location at the same time. The impacts of
            such overlap, as stated by the literature could extend from loss of
            productivity to property damage or death. Most of the current clash
            detection models are deterministic. However, the behavior of the
            crew (their performance and approach taken towards management of
            clashes) is more chaotic. The chaos mainly emerges from the
            dependency of clashes and their consequences on the human
            interactions among crew members and between different crews.
            Accordingly, the focus of this research is to explore
            non-deterministic modeling alternatives for the problem, such as
            agent-based modelling, in an attempt for higher accuracy and better
            simulation
          </p>

          <h6>Data Mining of Construction Operations (Araham)</h6>
          <p>
            Most of the construction projects suffer from overrun either in
            terms of time and cost scope, and/or deviation in quality compared
            to the expected requirements. A more realistic process and
            collaborative workflow plan requires continuous learning from
            previous projects. This entails properly documented ‘as-happened’
            experiences. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to
            determine deviations from as-planned processes and bottlenecks in
            construction projects in a fully automated manner. This will be
            realized through the application of process mining techniques to the
            data-infused BIM, which are fed with cutting-edge sensing and data
            acquisition technologies during execution phase. The research
            outcomes will help professionals in construction industry to plan
            and control for future projects based on the automatically
            identified lessons learned.
          </p>

          <h6>BIM-Sensory Data Integration (Arash)</h6>

          The integration of sensory data in BIM enables real-time status of
          building and spaces.BIM (Building Information Modeling) has valuable
          building information as it can store all the information that is
          required from the design stage of a building to its commissioning and
          maintenance. In order for BIM to serve the operation/service phases,
          it must be linked to the lifecycle information of the facility.
          Sensory data can be used to facilitate this process by providing this
          information to BIM in [near] real-time

          <h6>
            Identifying Sources of Confusion in Construction Contract Documents
            through Court Case Analysis (EI EI)
          </h6>

          Modular construction’s popularity is rising around the world. With
          this industry revolution, contract management surpasses the
          traditional contracting way into more collaborative approaches. There
          are multiple formats of contract conditions that are accessible in the
          industry for the different design and construction delivery
          methodologies, yet those are mostly drafted for traditional project
          delivery methods. Using these contract forms for modular construction
          gives rise to redundant disputes or claims and may lead to the project
          failure. Hence, the research objective is to provide a model for
          sources of confusion in construction contracts through a comprehensive
          review of the literature in both conventional and modular
          construction. Additionally, analysis of the relevant court cases from
          Supreme Court of Canada over the past 33 years (from 1986 to 2019)
          will be conducted to evaluate the impact of each source on
          construction litigation, claims and disputes by relating the motion of
          proceeding to the list of confusion sources.

          <h6>Integrating Citizen Feedback with 3D City Models (Farzaneh)</h6>

          With the aim of providing urban services, a high amount of money is
          invested in the management of urban infrastructure to maintain
          required levels of service and meet the expected performance of the
          system. Furthermore, the end-users of the infrastructure services are
          the ones who should approve the provision of the right services.
          Hence, it is critical to consider social structures in decision-making
          about different aspects of urban infrastructure projects. However,
          such a process is highly dependent on the availability of adequate
          models and techniques for processing the information provided. In this
          research, the streams of urban data provided by citizens are
          integrated with 3D city models to enrich urban information models with
          the data related to the infrastructure

          <h6>
            BIM-Based Collaboration & Interoperability for Construction
            Equipment (Felix)
          </h6>

          BIM-based collaborations are fundamentally based on data
          interoperability, digitalized model and processes. Site-layout
          planning & management is a crucial step for the collaboration.
          Currently, most of the current selection of the type of construction
          equipment and its location are handled by limited BIM reference model
          and information (Manufacturers’ instructions, Paper-based safety
          regulation, another document). Accordingly, the research focuses on
          the improvement of BIM software interoperability by enlarging the
          digitalized file format for construction equipment with attempting to
          real cases

          <h6>
            Energy Performance of Prefabricated Buildings (Leila)
          </h6>

          Prefabricated construction is defined as the practice of assembling
          structural components at a manufacturing site and transporting them to
          the jobsite. Prefabricated buildings are becoming more common in the
          construction industry; mainly because they help reduce construction
          time, as well as improve safety and environmental benefits compared to
          conventional construction methods. Moreover, de-carbonization as an
          essential target of current construction industry strategies, has
          started an effort to minimize the energy consumption in the usage
          stage since this phase has the largest share of total life cycle’s
          energy usage. Accordingly, the aim of this research is to understand
          the environmental and energy performance of prefabricated buildings.

            Integration of BIM & 3D GIS for comparison of individual and urban
            scale building energy modeling (Mahdis)
          </h6>

          Smart cities should deal with the information of different levels,
          from asset to neighborhood. Right now, these two criteria are
          considered as two different independent scopes. Whereas, the
          corporation between them is essential for district energy analysis,
          construction and operation improvements. For instance, in this
          research the focus would be on CityGML and IFC (Industry Foundation
          Class) as two of the most common information standards on the macro
          and micro levels, developed by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, 2012a)
          and buildingSmart Alliance, 2013a respectively. Consequently, the goal
          of this research is to compare the urban energy simulation results
          with the individual stand-alone building energy modeling outputs. The
          integration is supposed to be done using automated semantic techniques
          and data mapping. And, the final objective is to analyze the impact of
          influences of other buildings on an individual building performance,
          based on the integrated urban energy models of a district as a case
          study.

            Occupancy Pattern Detection using WIFI for Optimizing Building
            Systems Operation (Nastaran)
          </h6>

          Occupants’ behavior has a significant impact on energy consumption in
          buildings. The number of occupants can be used to optimize building
          operation systems. Therefore, a system for detecting occupants
          accurately and non-intrusively is crucial. One of the pre-existing
          data streams correlated with the number of occupants in buildings is
          WiFi data. The aim of this research is to analyze and estimate
          occupancy patterns by using WiFi data for employing that into HVAC
          control purposes.

            “Parametric Recommender System for Design of Cost-effective Energy
            Efficient Buildings (Rafaela)
          </h6>

          During the design phase of a building, the decisions made at the early
          stage are the ones that impact building’s lifecycle energy performance
          most. Today, however, due to the large number of possible design
          scenarios, such decisions still rely on rules of thumb and engineering
          judgement rather than the available building performance simulation
          tools. To try solving this problem, the goal of this research is to
          help designers to limit those scenarios by creating a recommender
          system that looks at building attributes and suggests scenarios that
          are worth taking into consideration during simulations. To accomplish
          that, a set of data analysis techniques are being explored to
          understand the behavior of energy influential parameters in different
          building models.
