                    <p> Abdelhady Hosny has been a Civil engineer with focus on
                      project management since 2009. He has completed his
                      masters in 2013 and is currently pursuing his PHD with
                      Concordia University. His areas of interest are focused

                    <h5>Non-deterministic Workspace Management in Construction </h5>
                    <p>
                      Spatial Temporal (Operational) Clashes happen when workspaces
                      overlap to share the same location at the same time. The impacts of
                      such overlap, as stated by the literature could extend from loss of
                      productivity to property damage or death. Most of the current clash
                      detection models are deterministic. However, the behavior of the
                      crew (their performance and approach taken towards management of
                      clashes) is more chaotic. The chaos mainly emerges from the
                      dependency of clashes and their consequences on the human
                      interactions among crew members and between different crews.
                      Accordingly, the focus of this research is to explore
                      non-deterministic modeling alternatives for the problem, such as
                      agent-based modelling, in an attempt for higher accuracy and better
                      simulation

                    <h5> BIM Process Mining in Construction Operations</h5>
                    <p>
                      Most of the construction projects suffer from overrun either in
                      terms of time and cost scope, and/or deviation in quality compared
                      to the expected requirements. A more realistic process and
                      collaborative workflow plan requires continuous learning from
                      previous projects. This entails properly documented ‘as-happened’
                      experiences. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to
                      determine deviations from as-planned processes and bottlenecks in
                      construction projects in a fully automated manner. This will be
                      realized through the application of process mining techniques to the
                      data-infused BIM, which are fed with cutting-edge sensing and data
                      acquisition technologies during execution phase. The research
                      outcomes will help professionals in construction industry to plan
                      and control for future projects based on the automatically
                      identified lessons learned.

                    <p>
                      The integration of sensory data in BIM enables real-time status of
                      building and spaces.BIM (Building Information Modeling) has valuable
                      building information as it can store all the information that is
                      required from the design stage of a building to its commissioning and
                      maintenance. In order for BIM to serve the operation/service phases,
                      it must be linked to the lifecycle information of the facility.
                      Sensory data can be used to facilitate this process by providing this
                      information to BIM in [near] real-time

                    <h5>Identifying Sources of Confusion in Construction Contract Documents
                      through Court Case Analysis </h5>
                    <p>
                      Modular construction’s popularity is rising around the world. With
                      this industry revolution, contract management surpasses the
                      traditional contracting way into more collaborative approaches. There
                      are multiple formats of contract conditions that are accessible in the
                      industry for the different design and construction delivery
                      methodologies, yet those are mostly drafted for traditional project
                      delivery methods. Using these contract forms for modular construction
                      gives rise to redundant disputes or claims and may lead to the project
                      failure. Hence, the research objective is to provide a model for
                      sources of confusion in construction contracts through a comprehensive
                      review of the literature in both conventional and modular
                      construction. Additionally, analysis of the relevant court cases from
                      Supreme Court of Canada over the past 33 years (from 1986 to 2019)
                      will be conducted to evaluate the impact of each source on
                      construction litigation, claims and disputes by relating the motion of
                      proceeding to the list of confusion sources.

                    <p>
                      With the aim of providing urban services, a high amount of money is
                      invested in the management of urban infrastructure to maintain
                      required levels of service and meet the expected performance of the
                      system. Furthermore, the end-users of the infrastructure services are
                      the ones who should approve the provision of the right services.
                      Hence, it is critical to consider social structures in decision-making
                      about different aspects of urban infrastructure projects. However,
                      such a process is highly dependent on the availability of adequate
                      models and techniques for processing the information provided. In this
                      research, the streams of urban data provided by citizens are
                      integrated with 3D city models to enrich urban information models with
                      the data related to the infrastructure

                    <h5>Energy Performance of Prefabricated Buildings </h5>
                    <p>
                      Prefabricated construction is defined as the practice of assembling
                      structural components at a manufacturing site and transporting them to
                      the jobsite. Prefabricated buildings are becoming more common in the
                      construction industry; mainly because they help reduce construction
                      time, as well as improve safety and environmental benefits compared to
                      conventional construction methods. Moreover, de-carbonization as an
                      essential target of current construction industry strategies, has
                      started an effort to minimize the energy consumption in the usage
                      stage since this phase has the largest share of total life cycle’s
                      energy usage. Accordingly, the aim of this research is to understand
                      the environmental and energy performance of prefabricated buildings.

                    <h5>Construction Worker/Asset Tracking On Site </h5>
                    <p>
                      The use of wearable sensing devices can open a new door toward safety management, productivity
                      monitoring and operational efficiency on construction sites. Localization systems provide
                      decision-makers with a timely warning if a worker is in proximity to danger areas or tagged
                      construction materials are placed in the wrong location. Estimating time spent in different
                      working zones can help in measuring actual productivity for working activities. The aim of this
                      research is to design a Real-Time Localization Service (RTLS) designed specifically for the
                      construction industry by considering practical factors such as ease of use, scalability and
                      adaptability to dynamism on site.

                    <p>
                      Smart cities should deal with the information of different levels,
                      from asset to neighborhood. Right now, these two criteria are
                      considered as two different independent scopes. Whereas, the
                      corporation between them is essential for district energy analysis,
                      construction and operation improvements. For instance, in this
                      research the focus would be on CityGML and IFC (Industry Foundation
                      Class) as two of the most common information standards on the macro
                      and micro levels, developed by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, 2012a)
                      and buildingSmart Alliance, 2013a respectively. Consequently, the goal
                      of this research is to compare the urban energy simulation results
                      with the individual stand-alone building energy modeling outputs. The
                      integration is supposed to be done using automated semantic techniques
                      and data mapping. And, the final objective is to analyze the impact of
                      influences of other buildings on an individual building performance,
                      based on the integrated urban energy models of a district as a case

                    <h5>Occupants' Behavior Modeling </h5>
                    <p>
                      The building sector accounts for almost a third of the total energy consumption worldwide, making
                      it crucial for designers, managers, owners and policy makers to clearly understand the prominent
                      factors and trends in building energy consumption. The occupants' behavior and how they interact
                      with the building energy systems are of great importance and yet to be fully understood. The
                      introduction of big data into the urban setting has facilitated endeavors to further study
                      occupant behavior. Masood aims to utilize big data and novel data mining techniques to extract
                      knowledge on occupant behavior, with the ultimate aim of improving the built environment's
                      resilience and sustainability.

                    <h5>Parametric Recommender System for Design of Cost-effective Energy
                      Efficient Buildings </h5>
                    <p>
                      During the design phase of a building, the decisions made at the early
                      stage are the ones that impact building’s lifecycle energy performance
                      most. Today, however, due to the large number of possible design
                      scenarios, such decisions still rely on rules of thumb and engineering
                      judgement rather than the available building performance simulation
                      tools. To try solving this problem, the goal of this research is to
                      help designers to limit those scenarios by creating a recommender
                      system that looks at building attributes and suggests scenarios that
                      are worth taking into consideration during simulations. To accomplish
                      that, a s et of data analysis techniques are being explored to
                      understand the behavior of energy influential parameters in different
                      building models.

                    <h5>Fault detection and Diagnosis in HVAC systems </h5>
                    <p>
                      Heating, Cooling and Air conditioning (HVAC) systems accounts for over 30% of electricity
                      consumption
                      in buildings. Therefore, careful maintenance of HVAC components is of a great importance to avoid
                      energy, environmental and economic losses. However, studies have shown that malfunctioning and
                      faults in HVAC systems result in significant energy wasting annually. Fault detection and
                      diagnosis (FDD)
                      is known as an approach to deal with the addressed issues. Various techniques are applied to
                      detect and
                      diagnose the faults in the early stages prior to complete system failure, which save energy and
                      cost to a
                      large extent.Current research mainly focuses on applying Machine learning methods to detect and
                      diagnose faults in
                      HVAC systems.

                    <p>
                      Occupants’ behavior has a significant impact on energy consumption in
                      buildings. The number of occupants can be used to optimize building
                      operation systems. Therefore, a system for detecting occupants
                      accurately and non-intrusively is crucial. One of the pre-existing
                      data streams correlated with the number of occupants in buildings is
                      WiFi data. The aim of this research is to analyze and estimate
                      occupancy patterns by using WiFi data for employing that into HVAC
